# chat-console
A console application to chat with ChatGPT using the OpenAI Chat API. Requires a Paid account and an API key at OpenAI.


## Getting started
First you'll need [an OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup), second you'll need [a paid account](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/payment-methods) by adding a payment method and lastly you'll need to create [an API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to use with this application.

When you have the API key start the application and run the command

    /set ApiKey <you-api-key>
  
  
The console will echo the new setting. For the `ApiKey`-setting you'll have to close the program (use `/quit`) and open it again. For all other settings the `/set` and `/reset` commands will be in effect immediately after being executed.


## Help
